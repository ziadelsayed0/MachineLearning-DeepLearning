Each section performs a specific transformation on the data to ensure it's suitable for modeling. Below is a summary of the sections:\n","\n","1. **Dataset Importation**: The dataset is loaded using `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.\n","2. **Feature Selection**: Independent (X) and dependent (Y) variables are extracted from the dataset, where X contains the features, and Y is the target variable.\n","3. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the dataset are handled using `SimpleImputer`, which replaces `NaN` values with the mean of the respective feature.\n","4. **Encoding Categorical Data**: The dataset contains categorical variables, which are encoded using `LabelEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder` to convert them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n","5. **Train-Test Split**: The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.\n","6. **Feature Scaling**: Standardization of features is done with `StandardScaler`, which normalizes the feature values to ensure that each has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n","\n","The diagram below illustrates these preprocessing steps:\n","\n","![Data Preprocessing Workflow](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/steps_for_data_preprocessing-f_mobile.png)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"c66ccc55","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-31T22:57:48.534155Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-31T22:57:48.533419Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-31T22:58:01.068425Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-31T22:58:01.067126Z"},"id":"NeTri3Ay1Z1s","outputId":"7aff8ce1-119d-4fbe-d1da-fb0276a0c0ac","papermill":{"duration":12.54338,"end_time":"2024-10-31T22:58:01.071213","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-10-31T22:57:48.527833","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: scikit-learn in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (1.0.2)\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: joblib>=0.11 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from scikit-learn) (1.2.0)\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.14.6 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from scikit-learn) (1.21.6)\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: scipy>=1.1.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from scikit-learn) (1.7.3)\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: threadpoolctl>=2.0.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from scikit-learn) (3.1.0)\r\n","\u001b[33mWARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.
