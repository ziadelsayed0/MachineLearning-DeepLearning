A critical feature of modern chatbots is their ability to remember and utilize conversation history, enabling more coherent, context-aware, and personalized interactions.\n\nIn this notebook, we will create a chatbot using Facebook's [BlenderBot-400M-Distill](https://huggingface.co/facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill), a lightweight yet powerful conversational model fine-tuned for open-domain dialogues. To make our chatbot more dynamic, we will implement a memory mechanism that stores and retrieves conversation history. This enhancement will allow the chatbot to:\n\n- Refer back to previous user inputs or topics.\n- Maintain a coherent flow during multi-turn conversations.\n- Provide personalized and contextually relevant responses.\n\n## What You’ll Learn\n<img src=\"https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1445426863/vector/chat-bot-vector-logo-design-concept.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=XDdfzS4lNW9yxQ0BQGZq9KMLL4bJ8ywXlYdAhBSuoCA=\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"35%\" align=\"right\"/>\n\n1. **Introduction to BlenderBot-400M-Distill**  \n   Understand the model's architecture, features, and why it’s an excellent choice for building conversational agents.\n\n2. **Implementing Conversation Memory**  \n   Learn how to design a memory mechanism to store and manage chat history.\n\n3. **Building the Chatbot**  \n   Deploy the BlenderBot-400M-Distill model using the Hugging Face Transformers library and integrate the memory system.\n\n4. **Testing the Chatbot**  \n   Evaluate the chatbot's performance in maintaining context across multi-turn conversations.\n\nBy the end of this notebook, you will have a fully functional chatbot capable of engaging in natural, context-aware dialogues. Let’s dive in and start building your conversational AI system!\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Use a pipeline as a high-level helper\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nmyChatbot = pipeline(\"text2text-generation\", model=\"facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill\")","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-25T16:30:06.408193Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-25T16:30:06.408445Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-25T16:30:33.283598Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-25T16:30:06.408415Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-25T16:30:33.282640Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"user_message = \"do you have any tips for improving my learning speed ?\"\n\nresponse = myChatbot(user_message)\nprint(response[0]['generated_text'])","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-25T16:30:33.292005Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-25T16:30:33.292316Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-25T16:30:34.410813Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-25T16:30:33.292271Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-25T16:30:34.409885Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":" Just keep at it and don't get discouraged.
